# ClassyAI

A GMU November Hackathon Project

ClassyAI is a lightweight Flask-based backend + HTML/JS frontend tool that recommends the best professors for a student’s upcoming classes. Using a mock dataset of realistic professor ratings and an AI explanation generator, ClassyAI helps students build smarter schedules quickly.

▶️ How to Run the Backend (Local)
1. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Set your OpenAI API Key
Mac/Linux:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
Windows CMD:
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

3. Start the server
   python app.py

   The backend runs at:
http://localhost:5000

⚡ Testing the API (Thunder Client)
	1.	Open VS Code → Thunder Client
	2.	Click New Request
	3.	Set method to POST
	4.	URL: http://localhost:5000/recommend
  5.	Click Body → JSON
	6.	Paste: {
  "courses": ["CS 112", "MATH 113"]
}
  7.	Send → You get ranked professors + explanation.

🎨 Frontend

The frontend (index.html) allows students to:
	•	Enter classes
	•	Click “Generate Recommendations”
	•	Display ranked professors + AI explanation

Uses simple fetch() calls to connect to the backend.
